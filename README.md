Not much of me, im just a student who is interested in programming and science, if you want to reach me you will find a way eventually
I don't like leaving information about me online, I currently work with python and javascript but in future I would 
like to widen my computer language variety by learning C programming languages, java and couple other handful of languages that might be useful.

I'm currently indermediate at python and only a beginner at javascript but as time goes on I will definitely get better at them.
